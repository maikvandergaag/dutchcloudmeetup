Our second meetup will be at the office of IBIS, in the Groot Handelsgebouw (floor 6) near Rotterdam Central Station. This evening we have two great sessions, of which the first is now confirmed. The agenda for the evening is as follows:

**17:30 - 18:30**  : Walk in, welcome and dinner

**18:30 - 18:35** : Welcome

**18:35 - 19:20** : André Kamman: Azure Databricks and/or Azure SQL Datawarehouse

**19:20 - 19:30** : Break

**19:30 - 20:15** : Stefan Hoogendoorn: GCP DataPlatform and BigQuery in particular

**20:15 - 20:45** : Drinks with a PubQuiz!


In the first session of this evening, André will tell us more about the Azure Data Platform and two services in particular. Which use cases fit with Azure Databricks and in which scenarios do you use a Data Warehouse?

Next up is Stefan Hoogendoorn. He will also start by introducing a Data Platform, but now that that of Google Cloud Platform. After bringing us up to speed on the platform as a whole, he will dive deeper into BigQuery, one of it’s prominent offerings.
