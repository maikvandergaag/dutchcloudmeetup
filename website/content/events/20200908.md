In the season 2020/2021 we hope to have five MeetUps and this evening will be the first. Tonight we will learn about managing cloud infrastructure, but without choosing a cloud specific implementation like Azure ARM Templates or AWS CloudFormation. Instead the sessions will be about Terraform and Pulumi.

This MeetUp will be held online using Microsoft Teams and the link to join will be posted here roughly 30 minutes before we start.

The program:

**19:30-19:35**: Welcome and sorting out connectivity issues

**19:35-20:20**: First speaker: Adin Ermie - IaC using Terraform

**20:20-20:30**: Bio-and-drinks break

**20:30-21:45**: Second speaker: Mikhail Shilkov - Cloud Management Superpowers with Pulumi


Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
Come learn the benefits of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), what Terraform is and why people love it, along with a breakdown of the basics (including live demo deployments). Then wrap up with a comparison of Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
