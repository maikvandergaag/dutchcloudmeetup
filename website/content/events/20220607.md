The Dutch Cloud Meetup is organizing sessions for Cloud Takeaways. Cloud Takeaways is an event that is organized multiple times a year with great content on the Microsoft Cloud.
Each event will be one session by acknowledged speakers within the Microsoft community. For June we have one session:

**Gonzalo Bissio**

**Data & AI Specialist @Microsoft**

A truly passionate about SQL Server on all of its editions (that include express as well (?)). I’m speaker of the PASS Argentina chapter, father of Pedro, Fan of Club atletico Independiente from Argentina (Soccer or futbol fan 😛😛) and Rocky Balboa’s Soldier💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻. I have the following certifications -> Microsoft certified trainer, Azure Database administrator, Azure data engineer and Azure administrator but the most important one is that I LOVE AZURE SQL! On all of the versions :P

**Session:**

Azure SQL DB managed instance... A different SQL Server? On this session we will explore this new service. Migrations, backups, HA among other things that will help DBA’s to choose this option as a database platform.
