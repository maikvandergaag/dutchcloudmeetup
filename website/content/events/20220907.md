**Session:**

Pipelines are awesome for automating everything, it doesn’t matter if you are deploying something or just want some recurring tasks to be performed. But did you know that your pipelines could be a lot better? In this talk we’ll look at Azure DevOps YAML pipelines and all the wonderful features available to us. I'll share my tips and tricks for working with these amazing pipelines. We'll start by looking at implementing rollback scenario’s and how to make parts of your pipeline reusable in other pipelines. We will also look at speeding up the pipeline by running parts in parallel. There will definitely be something new to help you improve your pipelines. So, join me and level up your pipelines too!
