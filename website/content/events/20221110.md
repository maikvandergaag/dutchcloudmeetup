**Maarten Goet**

Maarten is a MVP since '07 and a RD since '15, and a regular speaker at conferences. He loves Azure & security, and is founder of ExpertsLive and the dutch Microsoft Security user group.

**Session: 52 mins from initial access to ransomware -- is your defensive team ready?**

Does your defensive team detect and respond fast enough to contain the adversary before they accomplish their mission? How do you know? Come join 15-year Microsoft MVP & RD Maarten Goet and learn how Microsoft Defender 365 and Microsoft Sentinel can help detect command-and-control platform Cobalt Strike, nasty exploits such as ZeroLogon and much more, in this real-world case where an attacker went from Zero to Domain Admin in just 52 minutes.
