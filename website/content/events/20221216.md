**Session:**

Governance provides mechanisms and processes to control your applications and resources in Azure. Governance involves determining your requirements, planning your initiatives, and setting strategic priorities.
To effectively apply your governance strategies, you must first create a hierarchical structure for your organizational environment. This structure lets you apply governance strategies exactly where theyâ€™re needed. The governance strategies we cover in this module are Azure policy and resource tags.
Authentication and authorization work together to help you manage your corporate identities and ensure strong protection for your organization. With these technologies, you can:
- Control access to your organization and corporates resources
- Store corporate passwords and secrets in a secure manner
- Integrate your identity solution for users and applications into Azure AD

Further, we will explore the monitoring solutions available in Azure. We assess Azure Monitor and its features, such as Application Insights and Azure Monitor Logs (Log Analytics), to analyze infrastructure, application performance, and availability.
