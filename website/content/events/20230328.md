**Session: Challanges you face as a Managed Service Provider**

As a Managed Service Provider (MSP) you run into all kinds of challenges that are different than those that SaaS companies or ISVs run into. Most of these circle around the observation that an MSP has many different clients that have different levels of expertise, knowledge and levels of legacy technology in their stacks.  This leads to technical challenges around the choice of choosing tooling for the automation of the service.

In this talk, you will learn which decision points and requirements play a role in tool selection at an MSP, and how we arrived at a particular tool (no, not spoiling that yet). After selecting a tool you off course run into other, more specific challenges to – which we will also discuss as lessons learned.
