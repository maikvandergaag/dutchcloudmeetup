This evening, we will be back with our last meeting before the Summer break! The theme for this evening will be Cloud Security. And, as this is in person, there will be a welcome with food and drinks, provided by our sponsor 3fifty.

As a special ending for this season 3fifty will organize a BBQ for all people attending the meetup.

I really enjoy to work on multidisciplinary challenges where people and technology need to be brought together.
