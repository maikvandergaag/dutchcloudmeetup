**Session: Be a shepherd for your data. Protect- and prevent data leaks, it's that simple!**

In a digitizing society more and more data is becoming available within the Microsoft 365 cloud today. Although we require devices to be compliant to synchronize data, users and guests are still able to download or copy data via the browser to unmanaged devices which is resulting in data leaks. During this session you'll learn how you can successfully prevent these scenarios with the use of Defender for Cloud Apps and make sure your data is protected against 'accidental' data leaks. We will show you how to configure Defender for Cloud Apps, what options are available to you and will 'leak' some live demos. After this session you'll have a clear understanding for which scenarios you're able to use Defender for Cloud Apps and how to configure this in your own environment.
